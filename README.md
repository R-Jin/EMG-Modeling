### a) Create the trains of potentials corresponding to each unit (8 trains in total).

### b) How many samples do each action potential train contain? Why? We expect a well-reasoned answer based on the theories discussed in class.

  <li><h3>How many samples do each action potential train contain? Why? We expect a well-reasoned answer based on the theories discussed in class.</h3></li>
  <li><h3>Plot 1 of the 8 action potential trains as a function of time (therefore you should have 0-20 s 
in the time axis). In addition, plot the same action potential train in the time interval 10-10.5 
s.
Note: All axes must be labelled. The unit for the time axis should be s (seconds); the unit for 
the amplitude of the action potentials is not provided and you should indicate A.U. (which 
stands for arbitrary unit).</h3></li>
  <li><h3>Comment on the procedure you have followed to obtain the proper time axis. We expect a 
well-reasoned answer based on the theories discussed in class.
</h3></li>
  <li><h3>Sum the 8 action potential trains in order to obtain the EMG signal. Plot the EMG signal as 
function of time (in the time interval 10-10.5 s).
